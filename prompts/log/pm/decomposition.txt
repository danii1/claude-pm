Decompose the following bug fix story into smaller, actionable tasks with detailed descriptions:

Story: {{storySummary}}

Description:
{{storyDescription}}

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on investigation, fix, testing, and validation tasks
- Suggest checking existing error handling patterns
- Consider both immediate fix and preventive measures

Requirements for each task:
- Focused on a single responsibility
- Completable within 1-2 days
- Not too granular (group similar small tasks together)
- Not too large (break down complex work)
- MUST include a detailed description formatted in MARKDOWN with:
  * Use ## for section headers (e.g., "## What needs to be done", "## Acceptance Criteria")
  * Use - for bullet points
  * Use **text** for important terms or emphasis
  * Use `code` for technical terms, function names, or code references

Return your response ONLY as valid JSON in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks, no additional text):

{
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "summary": "Brief, actionable task title",
      "description": "## What needs to be done\\n\\nDetailed explanation...\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- Criterion 1\\n- Criterion 2"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Each task MUST have a comprehensive description
- Format descriptions using MARKDOWN (headers, bullets, bold, code)
- This ensures proper formatting in Jira
