Analyze the following error log or bug report and generate PM-style requirements for a Jira story to fix the issue:

{{logContent}}
{{epicContext}}
{{extraInstructions}}

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on the user impact and business value of fixing this issue
- Describe the problem from a user perspective
- Avoid overly technical implementation details
- Suggest investigating existing code and patterns for the fix

Please analyze the log/error and provide the requirements in the following JSON format with MARKDOWN formatting:

{
  "summary": "Brief, clear title describing the bug or issue",
  "description": "## Problem Description\\n\\nClear explanation of what's broken from user perspective\\n\\n## Error Details\\n\\n```\\n{{logContent}}\\n```\\n\\n## Expected Behavior\\n\\n- What should happen\\n\\n## Actual Behavior\\n\\n- What currently happens\\n\\n## User Impact\\n\\n- Who is affected\\n- Severity and frequency\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- Issue is resolved\\n- No regression in related functionality\\n- Error handling is improved"
}

IMPORTANT:
- Format the description using MARKDOWN (## headers, - bullets, **bold**, `code`, ``` code blocks)
- This ensures proper rich formatting in Jira
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
