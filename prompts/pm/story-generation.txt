Analyze the following Figma design and generate PM-style requirements for a Jira story, don't be very technical, you are business/product person:

{{figmaUrl}}
{{epicContext}}
{{extraInstructions}}

IMPORTANT:
- Implementation should use the existing design system. DO NOT include specific design notes or styling details from Figma.
- BEFORE creating requirements, explore the current codebase to identify existing code that can be reused:
  * Check for existing API endpoints and client methods
  * Look for similar UI components that can be adapted
  * Review existing screens/pages for similar patterns
  * Search for Redux actions, reducers, selectors that might be relevant
  * Identify utility functions that could be leveraged
- Suggest reusing or adapting existing code rather than building everything from scratch, let Claude to explore itself, don't include your findings into a task

Please analyze the Figma design and provide the requirements in the following JSON format with MARKDOWN formatting:

{
  "summary": "Brief, clear title for the story",
  "description": "## User Story\\n\\nAs a [user type]\\nI want [goal]\\nSo that [benefit]\\n\\n## Design Reference\\n\\n{{figmaUrl}}\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- Criterion 1\\n- Criterion 2\\n- Criterion 3\\n\\n**Note:** Implementation must use existing design system components and patterns, not Figma-specific styling."
}

IMPORTANT:
- Format the description using MARKDOWN (## headers, - bullets, **bold**, `code`)
- This ensures proper rich formatting in Jira
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
