Break down the following story into actionable subtasks:

Story: {{storySummary}}

Description:
{{storyDescription}}

IMPORTANT:
- Create specific, actionable subtasks that can be worked on independently
- Focus on user-facing deliverables and testable outcomes
- Keep implementation details minimal - let developers determine the "how"
- Suggest researching existing code patterns as part of the work
- Each subtask should deliver incremental value
- Order subtasks logically (research → design → build → test)

Please provide subtasks in the following JSON format with MARKDOWN formatting:

{
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "summary": "Clear, action-oriented title",
      "description": "## Goal\n\n[What needs to be achieved]\n\n## Details\n\n- Specific requirements\n- Expected outcomes\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Deliverable is complete\n- [ ] Quality criteria met"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Format descriptions using MARKDOWN (## headers, - bullets, **bold**, `code`)
- Each subtask should be completable in a reasonable timeframe
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
