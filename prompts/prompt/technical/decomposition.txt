Break down the following story into technical subtasks:

Story: {{storySummary}}

Description:
{{storyDescription}}

IMPORTANT:
- Create specific, technical subtasks with clear deliverables
- Include both implementation and testing tasks
- Consider architecture, implementation, testing, and documentation
- Suggest exploring existing codebase patterns first
- Order tasks to minimize blockers (research → setup → implementation → testing)
- Each subtask should be independently verifiable

Please provide subtasks in the following JSON format with MARKDOWN formatting:

{
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "summary": "Clear, technical title indicating the deliverable",
      "description": "## Objective\n\n[Technical goal of this task]\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- Implementation requirements\n- APIs/interfaces to create/modify\n- Dependencies and integration points\n\n## Testing\n\n- Unit tests needed\n- Integration test scenarios\n\n## Acceptance\n\n- [ ] Code complete and reviewed\n- [ ] Tests passing\n- [ ] Documentation updated"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Format descriptions using MARKDOWN (## headers, - bullets, **bold**, `code`, ``` code blocks)
- Include both implementation and verification tasks
- Each subtask should be completable independently where possible
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
