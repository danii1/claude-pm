Analyze the following requirement or feature description and generate technical requirements for a Jira story:

{{promptContent}}
{{epicContext}}
{{extraInstructions}}

IMPORTANT:
- Include technical considerations and implementation approach
- Identify potential technical challenges
- Suggest architecture patterns and best practices
- Reference existing codebase patterns when relevant
- Balance user value with technical feasibility

Please analyze the requirement and provide it in the following JSON format with MARKDOWN formatting:

{
  "summary": "Brief, clear title for the story",
  "description": "## Overview\n\n[High-level description of the feature/requirement]\n\n## User Story\n\nAs a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Architecture patterns to use\n- Integration points\n- Data model changes\n- API design considerations\n- Performance implications\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n1.

- Format the description using MARKDOWN (## headers, - bullets, **bold**, `code`, ``` code blocks)
- This ensures proper rich formatting in Jira
